# Person B Handoffs

## Day 1 — Person B

### Done
- Initialized the Next.js App Router frontend inside `apps/web` with strict TypeScript and Tailwind CSS.
- Created a polished responsive developer-tool shell with desktop sidebar, mobile navigation, active-route state, skip link, semantic landmarks, visible focus, and reduced-motion behavior.
- Added page shells for dashboard, repositories, activity, reports, GitHub, settings, login, registration, forgot-password, and reset-password.
- Added `packages/ui` primitives: button, input, label, card, table, badge, dialog, skeleton, empty state, and error state.
- Added deterministic illustrative workspace fixtures and MSW browser/server handlers.
- Added Vitest/React Testing Library and Playwright configuration.
- Added frontend-local environment and setup documentation.
- Clearly marked all fixture-backed information as illustrative and all later-day controls as unavailable or planned.
- Completed a focused visual-direction pass before handoff: deeper ink/cobalt contrast, differentiated metric accents, stronger brand signal treatment, dimensional surfaces, and restrained motion with reduced-motion support.

### Person B-owned files changed
- `apps/web/**`
- `packages/ui/**`
- `docs/frontend-setup.md`
- `docs/person-b-handoffs.md`

No Person A-owned file or root workspace file was changed.

### Contract consumed
- Domain/version: None on Day 1.
- Fixture path: `apps/web/src/mocks/fixtures/workspace.ts`
- No direct shared-contract edits: YES

### Mock versus real status
- Mock-backed: Dashboard metrics/activity, repository previews, activity previews, GitHub state, and all page shells.
- Real adapter: None; intentionally deferred.
- Joint smoke test: Not applicable until a prior-day backend contract and endpoint are available.

### Tests and builds actually run
- Expected RED: `pnpm --filter @trace/ui test` — failed because UI exports did not exist.
- Expected RED: `pnpm --filter @trace/web test` — failed because shell/page/fixture modules did not exist.
- `pnpm --filter @trace/ui test` — PASS, 2 tests.
- `pnpm --filter @trace/web test` — PASS, 6 tests.
- `pnpm --filter @trace/ui typecheck` — PASS.
- `pnpm --filter @trace/web lint` — PASS, no warnings or errors.
- `pnpm --filter @trace/web typecheck` — PASS.
- `pnpm --filter @trace/web build` — PASS, 12 static routes generated.
- `pnpm --filter @trace/web test:e2e` — PASS, 22/22 desktop and mobile tests.
- Production HTTP smoke — `/dashboard` and `/login` served from the rebuilt Next.js production output.
- Rendered visual inspection — PASS on desktop and Pixel 5 viewport; no clipping, overlap, or unusable navigation found.
- Quantitative contrast samples — PASS, 4.68:1 to 16.55:1 across changed text/control pairs.
- Browser console inspection — PASS, no JavaScript errors.

### Contract change requests
- None.

### Problems/risks
- Standalone Codex delegation was unavailable because its CLI authentication returned HTTP 401. Direct implementation continued; no repository changes came from the failed process.
- Initial Playwright configuration reused an unrelated service on port 3000, producing false-positive route checks. Playwright now uses an isolated non-reused port 3100 and verifies exact route headings.
- A stale Trace Playwright server later occupied port 3100 during the visual-polish rerun. It was identified by executable and working directory, stopped, and the 22-test browser suite was rerun successfully against a fresh server.
- Running the Playwright dev server replaces the production `.next` output; the final production build must run after browser tests before `next start`.
- The root lockfile remains integration-owner-controlled and was not created or modified.
- Next.js 14 and ESLint 8 emit upstream deprecation notices during dependency installation, but lint, typecheck, tests, and build pass. Dependency modernization should be coordinated rather than changed during Day 1.

### Next-day joint gate
- READY, subject to Person A publishing the frozen Day 1 auth/session/error contract and fixture.
- Day 2 Person B work: registration, login, logout/session UX, protected layout behavior, forgot/reset password, API-client cookie/CSRF handling, and auth error/loading states against contract mocks.
